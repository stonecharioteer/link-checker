# link-checker

Check all URL strings in a repository and validate if they are valid and working.

## Existing Tooling

There are other tools/actions that perform this particular function, but most of them only target HTML files and/or markdown files.
I wanted to write something that checks *any* file you want.

## TODO

- [ ] Update this README with the details of this action
- [ ] Update inputs/outputs in `action.yaml`
- [ ] Implement the action's logic in `src/main.rs`
- [ ] Trigger a release in GitHub Actions
- [ ] Edit the triggered release to set release notes and publish the action to GitHub Marketplace
